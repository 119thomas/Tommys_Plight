Here are some particle clouds as example. The Order in Layer is -40. You can change it if you select cloud, then go to it's Inspector - Particle System - Renderer and set "Order in Layer to what you need.
We are trying to do some 2d sprite clouds, but now they are not looking good. We will try add them later.
